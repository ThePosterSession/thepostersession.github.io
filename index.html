  <h2> People and Community </h2>

  <p> The Poster Session is intended to bringing people together and connecting, very much like in a poster session of an academic conference. Unlike previous events, there are no speakers and not one single communication flow. The event is free of charge, with food and drinks provided. A “poster” is simply a 3’x 4’ board on which you have information about what your company does. </p>

  <br>
	
  <h2>Academia and Industry</h2>

	<p>Learn about new technologies and discoveries made in companies or research centers, or come show your latest achievements.</p>
